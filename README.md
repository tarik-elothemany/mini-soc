# SOC Architect - Technical Challenge: Mini SOC with Wazuh & Docker Swarm

This repository contains the solution for the "SOC Architect - Technical Challenge, Part One - Build a Mini SOC."
The goal is to design, implement, and document a CI/CD pipeline that deploys a Wazuh SIEM stack onto a Docker Swarm cluster.

## Architecture Overview & Diagram

*(To be filled out: Describe the overall architecture of the Wazuh SIEM deployed on Docker Swarm, including ingress, networking, and CI/CD components. Include a diagram.)*

---

## Prerequisites (Runner Setup, Required Tools)

### Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runner Requirements:
- **Operating System:** Linux (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
- **Docker:** Docker Engine (CE or EE) installed and running, user added to `docker` group.
- **Ansible:** Latest stable version of Ansible.
- **Python:** Python 3.x with `pip`.
- **Trivy:** Latest version of Trivy for image scanning.
- **Chrome/Chromedriver (or Playwright+Selenium bindings):** For UI automation tests. Specific versions compatible with Selenium and your chosen browser.

*(Any additional runner prerequisites will be documented here.)*

---

## How to Run Locally and Via CI

*(To be filled out: Instructions for setting up a local Docker Swarm and deploying the stack, as well as triggering the CI/CD pipeline.)*

---

## How Secrets/TLS are Managed

*(To be filled out: Detail the chosen strategy for handling secrets (e.g., GitHub Actions Encrypted Secrets, Swarm Secrets, Ansible Vault) and managing TLS certificates.)*

---

## Rollback/Recovery Steps

*(To be filled out: Outline the procedures for rolling back failed deployments and recovering from component failures.)*

---

## Wazuh Stack Components

*(To be filled out: Details about the Wazuh Indexer, Manager, and Dashboard services, including their configurations and persistence.)*

---

## CI/CD Pipeline Details

*(To be filled out: Explanation of the GitHub Actions workflow, build, scan, test, and deploy steps.)*

---

## Testing Strategy

*(To be filled out: Description of Selenium UI tests and API health probes.)*

---

## Security & Secrets Management

*(To be filled out: Detailed explanation of how secrets are protected, including Wazuh credentials, API keys, and TLS private keys. Discuss secret rotation and least-privilege choices.)*

---

## Certificate Management

*(To be filled out: How HTTPS termination is handled (reverse proxy, ACME/Let's Encrypt or internal CA), and automation for provisioning/renewal.)*

---

## Quality Gates & Policies

*(To be filled out: How Trivy critical/high vulnerabilities halt the pipeline, and details on linting (Ansible, YAML) and PR merge requirements.)*

---

## Evidence

*(To be filled out: Links to CI runs, screenshots of the Wazuh dashboard, Trivy reports, and Ansible output.)*

---

## Assumptions Document

*(To be filled out: Any assumptions made regarding DNS, domain/TLS setup, runner permissions, IP addresses, etc.)*

---

## High-Level Design (HLD)

*(Optional - To be filled out in `docs/HLD.md` if implemented, with a summary here.)*

---

## Low-Level Design (LLD)

*(Optional - To be filled out in `docs/LLD.md` if implemented, with a summary here.)*

---

## Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan

*(Optional - To be filled out, with a summary here.)*

---

## Update & Data Migration Planning

*(Optional - To be filled out, with a summary here.)*
